# Shadowboxing Analyzer

Since boxing is the main reason behind my commits slowed down, I start this project in order to keep my coding skills sharp. I will try to implement a shadowboxing analyzer that will be able to detect the punches thrown by the user and give feedback on the form of the punches. I will use OpenCV and OpenPose and Python for this project. I will also try to implement a GUI for this project. I will update this README file as I progress through the project.

# About my project

In order to achive the project goal I will look to implement the following features:

1. Get poses and angles landmarks from a video
2. Detect punches from the landmarks and angles
3. Detect the form of the punches
4. Give feedback on the form of the punches
5. Implement a GUI for the project.
