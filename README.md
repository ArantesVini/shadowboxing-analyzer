# Shadowboxing Analyzer

Since boxing is the main reason behind my commits slowed down, I start this project in order to keep my coding skills sharp. I will try to implement a shadowboxing analyzer that will be able to detect the punches thrown by the user and give feedback on the form of the punches. I will use OpenCV (maybe?) and Python for this project. I will also try to implement a GUI for this project. I will update this README file as I progress through the project.
